      </header>
      <p>After graduating highschool I attempted to go into Video Game Design. Due to life events I ended up going into various sales jobs which lead me into banking. Even through those events a never lost my passion to develope software. Through my current employer I was offered another chance to get into that passion of becoming a software developer.</p>
      <p>I now am a student at thinkful. Outside of that I enjoy playing video games and spending time with my wife. I luckly ended up being with a partner that makes life that much more enjoyable. We have been together for ten years now. I would like to take what I have learned and work with a team to develop software. Feel free to connect with me through my links below.</p>
